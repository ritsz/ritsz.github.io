### Memory Reordering
* Changes to memory ordering are made both by the compiler (at compile time) and by the processor (at run time), all in the name of making your code run faster.
* Both CPU and compiler, cannot modify the behavior of a single-threaded program.
* Hence memory reordering is not observed by the end user in single threaded programs, and multi threaded programs using synchronization primitives.
* Memory reordering is observed only in case of a lock free program with shared memories.
* Java's `volatile` and C++'s `atomic` provided sequentially consistent data types (On the same CPU, Load and store on these data types happen in the order they are expressed in the program.)

### Processor Reordering
* A processor is allowed to reorder instruction (memory interations), as long it never changes the execution of a single-threaded program.
* Processor is allowed to delay the effect of a store past any load from a different location.
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    // Thread 1
    mov [PTR_A], 1
    mov rax, [PTR_B]

    // Thread 2
    mov [PTR_B], 1
    mov rab, [PTR_A]
{% endhighlight %}
* Assuming the above code is running parallely on 2 processors, depending on execution flow, the expectation would be either or both of `rax` and `rbx` to be one.
* Since processor is allowed to reorder independent memory interations, there is a possibility that both `rax` and `rbx` are zero.
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    // Thread 1 - Reordered
    mov rax, [PTR_B]
    mov [PTR_A], 1

    // Thread 2 - Reordered
    mov rab, [PTR_A]
    mov [PTR_B], 1
{% endhighlight %}
* To prevent this, introduce a CPU barrier between the two instructions. Here, weâ€™d like to prevent the effective reordering of a store followed by a load. In common barrier parlance, we need a StoreLoad barrier.
* On x86/64, `mfence` instruction is a full memory barrier (not just a Store Load barrier).
* On x86/64, any locked instruction, such as xchg, also acts as a full memory barrier.
* In Linux kernel, `smb_mb, smb_wmb, smb_rmb` act as platform independent memory barrier, write memory barrier, and read memory barrier respectively.

### Compiler reordering
* The compiler has some freedom to sort the order of operations during compile time in the hope of optimization.
* `asm volatile("" ::: "memory");` can be used to prevent compiler reordering, though it still doesn't eliminate processor reordering.
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    X = 1;
    asm volatile("" ::: "memory");
    r1 = Y;
{% endhighlight %}
* In the above example, without the memory fence, since X, Y, and r1 are indepedent memory areas, compiler can reorganize for `r1 = Y` to happen before `X = 1`, which could lead to undesired results [IF THE ARE SHARED MEMORY AREAS.]
* The memory fence gaurantees that memory operations don't cross that boundary. Things above and below it can be reordered among themselves but cannot be reordered in such a way that they cross the memory fence.
* In C++11 atomic library standard, every non-relaxed atomic operation acts as a compiler barrier as well.
{% highlight cpp linenos %}
    int Value;
    std::atomic<int> IsPublished(0);

    void sendValue(int x)
    {
        Value = x;
        // <-- reordering is prevented here!
        IsPublished.store(1, std::memory_order_release);
    }
{% endhighlight %}
### Atomic operations.
* No thread can observe the atomic operation half complete.
* Aligned reads and writes of simple types are usually atomic.
* C++11 has `std::atomic<T>::fetch_add` to perform atomic read-modify-write.

### Compare-and-swap
* Programmers perform compare-and-swap in a loop to repeatedly attempt a transaction. This pattern typically involves copying a shared variable to a local variable, performing some speculative work, and attempting to publish the changes using CAS.
