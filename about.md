### More Information

Hi, my name is Ritesh Ranjan. I am currently working as a developer at VMWare, where my team and I work on ESXi LifeCycle and Update management. My areas of interests are Systems Programming, Distributed Systems, and Networking. The point of this blog is to act as a note making tool for me, where I plan to dump/compile my notes on various topics that interest me.
