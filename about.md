### More Information

Hi, my name is Ritesh Ranjan. I am currently working as a developer at Commvault Systems, where my team works on building data protection and archiving solutions for unix platforms. My areas of interests are Systems Programming, Distributed Systems, and Networking. The point of this blog is to act as a note making tool for me, where I plan to dump/compile my notes on various topics that interest me.
